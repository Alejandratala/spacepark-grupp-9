Today I made it so anyone that is a starwars person can come in with the ship selection of their choice, if the  person has a ship they own that/those ships will appear up top of the ship list.  Added the History to the menu functionality to the program that way the costumer can view their stays in the Spacepark.  Re-worked the SwApi that validates the persons name to make it more exact in order to prevent bugs when they enter their name (there was a bug where if you typed "Luke " with the space the program would crash, thats the reason as to why i reworked the validate name method for the SwApi)
